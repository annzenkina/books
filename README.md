# README

I've been reading Agile Web Development With Rails and I wanted to build a Rails to practice.

I like to read, that's why I decided to create an app to store information about books that I've read and that want to read.

There are three tabs in the app:

– Books
  List of all books in the world. I've downloaded it from the [Book-Crossing Dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/)
– Read Books
  This is the list with books I've read for now. It shows the title of the book and when I've read it (added to Read books)
– Wishlist
  A list with books that I want to read in the future. When I finish reading a book I can click on "destroy" button in the list and it will ask prompt me about moving it to Read_list.

I used gem "Kaminari" for pagination.
